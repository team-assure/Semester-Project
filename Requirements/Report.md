## Security requirements based on assurance claims

### Assurance Claims
The final assurance claims for the MISP project are as follows:
  1. System prevents distribution of event information to those who are not permitted to view it.
  
  2. Role based access is implemented in an acceptably secure manner.
  
  3. The system's authentication mechanism is acceptably secure against common authentication attacks.
  
  4. There are no exploitable Cross-Site Scripting weaknesses in the code.
  
  5. The user management interface is acceptably secure.

  2. Access Control
  
     Description: Security requirements around access control should consider the restrictions placed on authenticated users.  Done properly, this will prevent attackers from accessing unauthorized functionality or data.
